        Hey everyone, I'm Sp4n0 or Spano however you want to spell it. I'm a 22 year old college student who really
        love streaming whenever I get the chance. I've been gaming for basically my entire life, and I really do believe
        that these streaming communities can connect people from all over the world and give them the chance to become
        really good friends.That being said all, I really want to do is try to entertain people. If someone is having a bad 
        day then I want to try and make it better by giving them something to laugh at, or just say hi and have a conversation 
        with them. Gaming is something that a lot of people believe is a waste of time or can cause bad behavior or habbits, 
        but in reality it can be such an incredibly positive thing in peoples lives. I just want to be able to show that side
        gaming by creating a community that supports and cares for each other because some people may not be good at socializing 
        in person.
